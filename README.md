Hello! This is the repository for my personal website and blog, a project I've been wanting to build for quite some time. It's my space to document my software development journey and contribute back to the community that's given me so much knowledge over the years.

## About This Project

This website is built with SvelteKit and serves as both my personal blog and knowledge base. I originally designed it in Figma over a year before launch (you can see the [original design here](https://www.figma.com/design/SCC4WOWbWyoPO0DKD5GEBw/ben-knox.com?node-id=0-1&t=wklsaIBbuKVvDRUl-1)), and it's finally come to fruition 🍇.

The main goal is simple: share knowledge, document experiences, and create a personal reference that others can learn from, just as I've learned from countless developers online.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS (custom design system)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Keycloak (author authentication)
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes

## About Me

I've been working in software professionally and personally out of pure passion. I'm particularly interested in website design and web application development. My experience includes PHP, Python, C#, Node.js, React, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, SvelteKit, Docker, Kubernetes, Figma, and Design Systems.

## Why This Repository?

This codebase represents my approach to building modern web applications with SvelteKit. I believe everyone has unique experiences to learn from, and I want to make mine available to others. Think of this as my personal knowledge base, open source and ready to reference.
